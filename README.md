# 🧾 FreeKasir

A free, offline-first, open source Point of Sale (POS) Progressive Web App built for Indonesian Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (UMKM). All data is stored locally on the user's device — no server, no registration, no cost.

- **Multi-Language** — Full Bahasa Indonesia, English, and Bahasa Malaysia translations via i18next. Language can be switched from Settings or during onboarding
- **Responsive Layout** — Mobile-first phone UI with landscape/tablet mode featuring side-by-side cashier (products + cart) and adaptive grid columns

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (recommended) or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+ (via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- npm, yarn, or bun

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/user/kasirgratisan.git
cd kasirgratisan

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be running at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Production Build (PWA/Web)

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Android Build (Capacitor)

This project can also run as a native Android app using Capacitor while keeping the PWA/web version working from the same codebase.

Requirements:

- Android Studio installed
- Android SDK configured
- JDK 21 (Android Studio bundled JBR works)

#### Set JAVA_HOME

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr"
```

> Adjust the path if your Android Studio is installed elsewhere.

#### Build debug APK

```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync android
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Output: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

#### Build release AAB (for Play Store)

```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync android
cd android
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

Output: `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

> The release AAB must be signed before uploading to Google Play. See [Android signing docs](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing).

#### Useful scripts

```bash
npm run cap:sync      # build web bundle and sync Capacitor
npm run cap:android   # build, sync, then open Android Studio
npm run cap:run       # build, sync, then run on connected Android device/emulator
```

## 💾 Database

All data is stored locally in the browser using IndexedDB (via Dexie.js). No data is ever sent to any server.

### Tables

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `users` | Multi-user accounts (owner/staff role, hashed PIN, granular permissions) |
| `categories` | Product categories (name, color, icon) |
| `products` | Master products (name, SKU, sell price, COGS, stock, unit, description) |
| `units` | Master units of measurement |
| `suppliers` | Supplier data |
| `stockIns` | Stock-in records |
| `stockOuts` | Stock-out records |
| `hppHistory` | COGS change audit trail |
| `paymentMethods` | Payment methods (Cash, Bank Transfer, QRIS, etc.) |
| `transactions` | Sales transactions (status: open/completed, customer name, table number, remarks) |
| `transactionItems` | Individual items within each transaction (per-item notes & discount) |
| `storeSettings` | Store settings & app state (incl. multi-user toggle) |

### COGS Calculation (Weighted Average)

When stock is received, COGS is automatically recalculated:

```
New COGS = ((Old Stock × Old COGS) + (New Qty × Buy Price)) / (Old Stock + New Qty)
```

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here's how:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Guidelines

- UI text uses **i18next** — add new strings to `src/i18n/locales/{id,en,ms}/` JSON files inside the appropriate namespace (`common`, `settings`, `products`, `reports`, `dashboard`, `onboarding`)
- Use `useTranslation('namespace')` hook and `t('key')` in components
- Currency and number formatting should be locale-aware using `i18n.language` and `NUMBER_LOCALES` / `CURRENCY_SYMBOL` maps
- Date formatting should use `date-fns` with locale from `LOCALES` map
- Use existing `shadcn/ui` components from `src/components/ui/`
- All monetary values are stored as numbers representing Indonesian Rupiah (no decimals)
- Format numbers using `toLocaleString('id-ID')`
- New features must work fully offline (no API calls)
- Use `useLiveQuery()` from `dexie-react-hooks` for reactive data binding
- Gate sensitive UI/actions with the `can()` helper from `useAuth()` when multi-user is enabled
